<h3>February 7, 2022</h3> 
<p>State station is one of the T's downtown transfer stations, between the Orange and Blue Lines. Unfortunately, I didn't actually get to leave this station, as both times I ended up here on Saturday was to transfer between the Blue and Orange Lines.</p>
<p>The Orange Line platform (the Oak Grove-bound one, I didn't visit the Forest Hills-bound one) wasn't bad. I could hear the train towards Forest Hills arriving while waiting for mine. I unfortunately didn't get any photos on this platform.</p>
<p>To get to the Blue Line, there's both a ramp and a set of stairs. Me and my brother ran between the Orange Line and Blue Line to get to <a href=../2022-02/mbta-maverick.html>Maverick</a>. In his words, we were "speedrunning Boston". I actually really liked the Blue Line platforms. This section of the station was renovated about 10 years ago, and is really clean.</p>

The Bowdoin-bound Blue Line platform, as viewed from the Wonderland-bound side.</p>
<p>Silver columns with white tops line both platforms, and there's even an area at the end of the Wonderland-bound platform near the hallway to the Orange Line where you can look into the tunnel.</p>

The tunnel goes towards Government Center and Bowdoin. This might look really cool if there was a train coming. I should've spent our 6 minute wait for a Blue Line train getting ready to take a photo of it coming in.</p>
<p>When we were on the Blue Line coming back from Maverick, I noticed that the annoucements said "State Street" instead of "State", neat quirk there.</p>
