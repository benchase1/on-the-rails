<h3>January 22, 2022</h3> 
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve looked at a RIPTA route, but here I am again with another RIPTA express route. The 10x is just as bad as the other ones. My friend Cedric - the one that I did the <a href=../2021-08/ri-intrastate-rail.html>Rhode Island Intrastate Rail post</a> with – had written a post on his now-defunct blog, The Providence Planner. (Quite a shame that’s it’s gone, but he’s working on another blog to come soon.) Cedric actually wrote his 10x post as a guest post for Miles in Transit in late June 2021, but it got rejected. Cedric gave this route a 3 out of 10 (I don’t give scores because they’ll end up being completely biased). That’s enough for the off topic rant.</p>
<p>First annoyance is the “Park-n-Ride” naming. Damn it RIPTA, using the out of date “-n-” stuff. Just call it a “Park and Ride”. (That’s just me bugging over a minor annoyance though.)</p>
<p>The route, just like most of the other express routes, runs peak hours only on weekdays. The 10x only runs one trip in each direction, departing inbound at 7:10 am and departing outbound at 5:04 pm. The route is scheduled to take about 40 minutes each way out to the Chopmist Hill Fire Station in Scituate.</p>
<p>The route does serve the main “downtown” of Scituate, albeit at 7 am and 5 pm. With no way back.</p>
<p>For ridership, the 10x is the least-used express and the least-used non-Flex route, receiving an average of 20 riders per day. But for two trips a day, that’s not bad considering that Scituate is a rural town where 93% of the town drives alone to work.</p>
