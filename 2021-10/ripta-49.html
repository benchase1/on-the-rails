<h3>October 25, 2021</h3> 
<p>Most buses exist to serve an actual purpose. They run in a certain area not seen by other routes or connect important areas that other routes don't. And then there's the 49 from RIPTA.</p>
<p>Why does this thing even need to exist? There are not just one but TWO high-frequency routes right near it (both east and west of it), those being the 1 and the R. This thing also runs three trips a day southbound and two trips a day northbound on weekdays only.</p>
<p>The bus leaves Miriam Hospital at 9:10 am, 3:10 pm, and 3:56 pm every day. The bus departs from Kennedy Plaza at 8:45 am and 3:31 pm for its return trip. The route takes approximately 20 minutes between the two endpoints.</p>
<p>This thing is useless. This route gets 24 riders per day and is the second-least used non-Flex route in the entire system.</p>
<p><b>Edit - March 6, 2022: </b>The 49 is on RIPTA's chopping block to be eliminated in 2022! Even RIPTA found it useless.</p>
