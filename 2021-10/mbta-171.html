<h3>October 24, 2021</h3> 
<p>I haven't really talked about MBTA stuff on here. That's because it's a massive system. I've got to start somewhere, and that starting point will be the 171.</p>
<p>Out of all the MBTA's bus routes, the 171 is the weirdest. This route runs two trips per day only in one direction. And very early in the morning.</p>
<p>The first of the two trips departs Nubian at 3:50 am and makes its way around the area until reaching Andrew at 4:02 am. The bus runs express through all the Logan Airport terminals between 4:16 and 4:23 am before continuing on to the Airport station on the Blue Line at 4:28 am.</p>
<p>The other trip leaves Nubian at 4:20 am and repeats the same process until arriving at the Blue Line station at 4:58 am.</p>
<p>Is that already weird enough? Well it gets weirder. Both 171 trips are actually just variants of the 15 signed as the 171. Both trips leave St. Peter's Square at 3:29 am and 3:59 am and continue on as the 171 when reaching Nubian 10 minutes later.</p>
<p>It does seem like a good way to get to the airport early in the morning though.</p>
