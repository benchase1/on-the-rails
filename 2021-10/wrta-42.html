<h3>October 10, 2021</h3> 
<p>There are five routes in which I would consider wack from their areas served. Those are the A, B, 29, 33, and 42. I have already ranted about the first four, so now it's time for the 42.</p>
<p>I'd consider the 42 to be the least wack out of the five. The route goes from Union Station to Webster through Auburn and Oxford. It serves the downtown area of all four places along the route, and provides Monday to Saturday service every 2 hours. Fairly standard for these "wack" routes.</p>
<p>Not much is wrong with this route actually. Oxford and Webster are fairly populous towns right outside Worcester, and both have thriving town centers.</p>
<p>Except for one thing. The express portion. One northbound trip on Saturday (the last one, at 7:50 pm) runs express from Webster to Auburn, skipping the Oxford portion. Instead of taking Route 12 to Auburn, it takes I-395. I wouldn't be calling this bad if it ran multiple times, especially during peak hours. But why for one late trip on a Saturday? Just why? It makes no sense at all. There can't be that much demand from a town of about 18,000 people to warrant one Saturday night express trip to the Auburn Mall and downtown Worcester.</p>

<p><b>Heli on October 11, 2021 at 10:40 am:</b> i think the last express trip is just to get to the garage quicker, not sure why its revenue but seems to be the only logical answer...
