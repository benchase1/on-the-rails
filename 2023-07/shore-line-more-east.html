<h1>Shore Line More East</h1> 
<h3>July 11, 2023</h3> 
<p>With the recent news that Connecticut is <a href=https://ctexaminer.com/2023/05/12/lamont-proposes-steep-cuts-to-shore-line-east-amidst-lagging-ridership/>cutting Shore Line East service</a>, what if it wasn't? What if instead, they had chosen to make Shore Line East better?</p>
<p>Shore Line East has a unique history compared to other rail lines in the region. The service started in 1990 as an alternate route for travelers during highway construction work. While the line was intended to be temporary, the line's popularity has kept the service running between New Haven and New London for over 30 years. The service was electrified in early 2022. The line doesn't serve a major metropolitan center like other frequent rail lines in the Northeast, and within a half mile of all nine stations on the line, there are 15,917 residents. As of July 2023, the line sees 12 weekday and 8 weekend round trips and advertises an easy connection to and from Metro-North trains to New York City. A one-way trip on the line can take anywhere between 60 and 80 minutes, depending on the train.</p>
<p>What would this new Shore Line East look like? For starters, expansion. This proposal is designed to link up with the original <a href=../2021-08/ri-intrastate-rail.html>RailRhode proposal</a> from August 2021, with all services having timed connections at Westerly. RailRhode service to New London would be discontinued, with Shore Line East trains replacing them. A branch northward from New London would also be operated, providing service to Willimantic, with intermediate stops at Uncasville, Norwich, and Windham. This service will not be through-running to and from New Haven, and a timed connection at New London is required for passengers. On the mainline between New Haven and Westerly, new intermediate stops will be added at Niantic, Stonington, and Mystic. As Mystic already sees occasional Amtrak service, it would make sense for Shore Line East services to also stop there while new stations built in Niantic and Stonington would be only for Shore Line East trains, with Amtrak passing through. In total, six new stations would be constructed, all located in denser areas, near both residential and commercial uses.</p>
<p>The <a href=sle-55.pdf>new schedule</a> would provide hourly service between 5 am and 11 pm on both the mainline and branch line to Willimantic. At an operating speed of 55 miles per hour, a full trip from New Haven to Westerly will take 75 minutes, reaching New London in 56 minutes. A trip from New London to Willimantic is scheduled to take 32 minutes, reaching Norwich in 14 minutes. The services are timed to connect to the RailRhode services further into Rhode Island as well as with Metro-North trains in New Haven.</p>
<p>I even made a map showing the proposed services, as well as connections with Metro-North, Hartford Line, and RailRhode.</p>

<p>Also, happy anniversary. I've now been going two years strong on this very blog, and thanks for sticking around! Whether you've been here since the summer of 2021, or have come along later, thank you. It's been fun so far. I've got more content planned, and hopefully I can pick up the pace with more frequent content, as late 2022 and 2023 so far have been relatively quiet here.</p>
