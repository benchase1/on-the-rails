<h3>July 24, 2022</h3> 
<p>Oh boy, another RIPTA post. For most RIPTA routes, service is mediocre, but A for effort with these. I've seen worse, but I've also seen better. However, RIPTA has some really good routes, most of which I haven't covered yet, like the R-Line and the 60. Most of these good routes operate near downtown Providence or are interlined. And then there's the 67. A really good route, in a place where I wouldn't really expect a good route by RIPTA. Condering <a href=../2022-02/ripta-63.html>the 63</a> and <a href=../2022-07/ripta-87.html>the 87</a>, the 67 is really good.</p>
<p>What makes the 67 an exception to RIPTA's local routes in the state's smaller cities? Well, it's in Newport, one of the state's major tourist centers. Just because it's in a major tourist area isn't all that makes it a great route though, because if that was the case, the 63 would be equally great, and just no. The 67's routing makes it a great route. You see, a lot of Newport's main attractions lie right between downtown and the southeastern coast, and the 67 serves most of it without many deviations at all.</p>
<p>The route starts at the Newport Gateway Center, where transfers are available to other RIPTA routes serving the Newport area (the 63, 64, 68) and express routes to Providence and beyond (the 14, 24L, 60). The route passes through downtown and some of the <a href=../2021-11/ripta-231.html>231's Flex zone</a>. The route passes by Newport's famous mansions, Salve Regina University, and the Cliff Walk before ending at the southern trip of Aquindneck Island. It's a tourist-oriented route, which is a really good thing.</p>
<p>The schedule is really good as well. Disclaimer - I'm writing this post in the middle of summer tourism season, and I'm using the summer 2022 schedule. I don't know what the off-season schedule (if there is one) is like. Right now, the route runs every 20 minutes on weekdays between 8 am and 8 pm. I thought this was RIPTA? Wait, this is RIPTA. This doesn't sound like what RIPTA would do. Well, they did. But wait, it gets better. On Saturdays, the route operates every 15 minutes between 10 am and 6 pm, and every 20 minutes between 9 am and 10 am, as well as between 6 pm and 8 pm. On Sundays, same thing, but it starts an hour later than on Saturdays.</p>
<p>As well, the route is free for the time being! Sponsored by Discover Newport, a local tourism agency, the 67 is free from now until the end of October 2022!</p>
<p>Final thoughts - HOLY SHIT RIPTA! Looks like they know how to run a tourist route! Frequent service to major tourist destinations all day long, every single day is what tourist areas need, especially during peak seasons. In expect that this route is less busier during the off-season, but it is still a major connector year-round for Salve Regina University and the southern part of Newport.</p>
