<h3>June 7, 2022</h3> 
<p>Every city with both an airport and public transit system should have one thing. A good and reasonably priced transit link between the airport and the rest of the city (looking at you, PANYNJ). But, with this being the WRTA, something has to be quite interesting.</p>
<p>The routing of the 2 is not very interesting at all. The route runs from Union Station and along Pleasant Street all the way to the airport. The route meets both the 3 and 6 along its way west. On Sundays, however, the 2 replaces the 6, and terminates at Tatnuck Square. Why not just call the Sunday trips the 6 and put it on the 6's schedule? This makes to sense to be part of the 2. The bus does a loop by Sunny Hill Dr, right along the border with Paxton.</p>
<p>The schedule is where this gets interesting. It's a good thing that the Worcester Airport sees bus service 6 days a week, but only between 1 and 6 pm. WRTA, you do know that the airport has morning flights, right? Even crazier, the airport trips skip the whole Sunny Hill Dr loop on their way out, but make it on their way into the airport. Outside of those issues, the 2 runs every 50 minutes (sometimes up to 70) between 6:30 am and 8:30 pm. On weekends, the route sees 50 - 60 minute headways between 10 am and 5 pm.</p>
<p>Final thoughts - Please just give us better airport service. I know the airport sees only a handful of flights per day, but they depart and arrive throughout the entire day, not just in the afternoon. If you're lucky, you can take the bus to or from the airport. Brings Sunday service down Chandler St as well, but just sign these trips as the 6.</p>
