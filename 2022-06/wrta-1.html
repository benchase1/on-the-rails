<h3>June 8, 2022</h3> 
<p>There are multiple ways to get to the Walmart right off Route 146. You have the 11, which stops there on its way to the southwestern edge of the city, you have the 4, travelling along Millbury St, and you have the 1... deviating around Vernon Hill.</p>
<p>The 1 starts at Union Station and briefly follows the 5, 12, and 16 until reaching Waverly St. The route turns onto Providence St to serve Worcester Academy, where it begins its massive deviation. The route travels 1.7 miles to end up 0.4 miles from where the deviation began. This deivation runs along Dorchester St to Rice Sqaure, where it meets the 5 and 12 again. The route proceeds back to Providence St via Granite St, meeting it at the Worcester Senior Center. The 1 travels down Providence St (again) until reaching the Walmart.</p>
<p>The route runs between 6 am and 9 pm with buses every 50 minutes. Some trips will only stop at the Worcester Senior Center by request (this is only after 7 pm). The route does see weekend service, with buses every 50 minutes been 9 am and 4 pm on Saturdays and between 10 am and 5 pm on Sundays. Seems like typical WRTA weekend service.</p>
<p>Final thoughts - Don't take the 1 unless your origin or destination is closest to the 1. The 4 and 11 run far better service to Walmart without deviating an extra mile and a half to serve the 5 and 12 again. But for 1 passengers, it's not a terrible route. Frequencies are some of the WRTA's best (yes, 50 minutes is some of the best) and it has pretty good hours on weekdays. Weekends aren't as great for service hours anyways with the WRTA.</p>
<p>And that's it! I've now written a rant for every single WRTA route in operation (as of today, June 8, 2022). It's a shame I ended with a not-so-interesting route... that's what happens when you do the wack ones in the fall. It's been quite fun seeing how my local RTA operates its fixed routes and how planning compares to other cities I've seen. There is one more post to wrap up the WRTA, and then, who know's what will be next for the WRTA on On the Rails.</p>
