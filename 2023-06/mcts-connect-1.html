<h1>Connect 1</h1> 
<h3>June 19, 2023</h3> 
<p>I've been to Milwaukee? Twice, actually. (The first trip was supposed to get a post, but was scrapped.) Last time I was in Milwaukee, in March, I remember looking out of the bus window, and while walking through downtown, that the city was getting a BRT line in "mid 2023," which after some research online, they had said that the line was opening June 4. Now this was three months in advance, I was a bit doubtful that they would have a date set three months in advance. That was a Sunday, and on my last weekend in the Midwest before I went home for the summer. I would have really loved to go see it on day one. I had never actually ridden any form of transit on its first day, so this would be my first time doing so. I checked every once in a while, to make sure if it was still June 4 or if it had changed. About two weeks before, it was still June 4, so I booked my Amtrak ticket up to Milwaukee to go see it!</p>
<p>The new BRT line - Connect 1 - is a 9-mile route replacing the Gold Line, running along Wisconsin Ave and Bluemound Rd from downtown to Milwaukee Regional Medical Center, where one can transfer to Waukesha Metro's 1. The route, which is the first BRT for both Milwaukee and the entire state of Wisconsin, operates with Connect-branded battery-electric buses. There are plans in the works for a second Connect route along 27th Street with a proposed opening in 2028.</p>

A Connect-branded bus.</p>
<p>On my first visit to Milwaukee, I was impressed by MCTS' operations. They have a really good frequent bus network, and the Gold Line (the predecessor to Connect 1) was part of that every 15 minutes or better network. The schedule of the Connect 1 makes sense for a BRT line. On weekdays, the buses are scheduled to come every 10 minutes during the day, and every 15-20 later in the evening, and every 15 minutes on weekends. Service operates 7 days a week from about 4 am to 1 am (5 am to 1 am on Sundays). The route takes about 35 minutes, which is about a 10 minute savings from the Gold Line. It is also fare-free until the end of September, which drew a number of passengers to the line on that Sunday just looking to try out the new route.</p>

The bus is fairly crowded mostly with joyriders on the first day of operation.</p>
<p>As the route is BRT, there are a number of BRT features present along the 9-mile route. The $55 million project included the construction of 35 new sheltered bus platforms, complete with level boarding, countdown clocks, and fare machines (turned off when I rode). These are very well sheltered, with a bench and a dedicated wheelchair area under the shelter. I have a nitpick with the countdown clocks, as they scroll horizontally on a one-line display, and it lists next departures for the next 90 minutes. 90 minutes is fine with a less frequent route, but this is a route that comes as often as every 10. The bus lanes aren't perfect, though. They clearly exist along the eastern part of the route, especially through downtown, but as one goes west, the dedicated lanes seem to disappear, but there is a complete street parking ban along the BRT corridor.</p>

Some stops (such as 16th Street) are shared with the 30, another frequent bus route heading north from downtown.</p>

The stop at Water Street, where the new bus platform takes away from street parking, instead of blocking the sidewalk. I like this.</p>
<p>Final thoughts - it's a well done BRT. Sure, the bus lanes closer to the west end of the route may not exist or are improperly marked, but it's really good. Stop spacing on the line is good, with stops located farther apart than the Gold Line stops were. The BEB is smooth and a fast way into downtown. It's a really good corridor to start on as well, connecting downtown, Marquette University, the medical center, and residential areas in the west part of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa, as well as a connection with Waukesha Metro. There are some kinks that need to be worked out with the schedule, I think, but it's frequent all day, every day. I listened to a number of passengers on board, and everybody liked that the bus was fast and frequent, especially in the early morning and stayed frequent into the evening. MCTS has proved to me already that they can provide reliable and frequent service, and they met my high expectations with the Connect 1!</p>
