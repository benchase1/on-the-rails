<h1>About the Editor</h1>

<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>Hello there! My name is Ben, I was born and raised in the suburbs of 
    Worcester, Massachusetts, but now reside in Chicago, pursuing a degree in Geography at DePaul 
    University. I currently aspire to be a transit planner in the future. I enjoy riding transit 
    when I get the opportunity to, but my main interest with transit is how routes and stops are planned out.
</p>

<p>I was born on October 17, 2003 (age 19) in Massachusetts and I've been a transit nerd since I was very young, falling 
    in love with both the MBTA in Boston and the MTA in New York City. I'm also a photographer. 
    I use they/he pronouns.
</p>

<p>My only prior experience with anything related to this was when I wrote a guest post on the popular 
    blog "Miles in Transit", and <a href="http://milesintransit.com/2019/09/23/guest-post-grafton/">my guest post</a> was on the Grafton MBTA station, which I have also wrote about 
    <a href="2021-07/grafton-mbta.html">on this blog</a> when it started in July 2021.
</p>

<p>This blog is where the <a href=https://edi.benchase.info>Eliot Deviation Index</a> was first <a href=2022-05/eliot-deviation-index.html>introduced</a>, and it grew to the point where I set up a whole new site just for it.</p>

<p>You can follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/itsbenchase">@itsbenchase</a>.</p>

<h3>Why? Just why?</h3>

<p>(I may have a catchphrase here of "Why? Just why?")</p>

<p>Why do I write a transit blog? What made me write one?</p>

<p>The first question is an easy one for me to answer - I enjoy it. Even if I only put a few minutes 
    of effort into this each time, it's something for me to talk about with people like Cedric (the guy 
    behind Stroadsblog RI). I might even be able to use this to my advantage in the future, you never know.
</p>

<p>The second one, however, is slightly harder. There are a few others I know who also write similar blogs. 
    I always enjoy reading these other blogs, and I have a slight bit of experience, so I just went with it.
</p>

<p>Below is a list of related blogs and YouTube channels from some friends of mine that I fully recommend for any 
    reader of On the Rails.
</p>
<p><a href="http://codsnook.hopto.org/">Cod's little internet nook</a> by Cod. He's on a quest to review every bus route 
and train station in southern New England, showing his experiences on the journeys to ride these routes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ClassyWhale">Classy Whale</a> by Caleb. Caleb posts a great video every week, 
usually focusing on transit and the sights around it. Thinks On the Rails is "a really cool blog, you should check it out."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.milesintransit.com">Miles in Transit</a> by Miles. My guest post in September 2019 
was what inspired me to write about what I like here. Miles is a great person and puts great content on his blog 
and YouTube channel of the same name.</p>
<p><a href="https://ranyasramblings.blogspot.com/">Ranya's Ramblings</a> by Ranya. They do what Cod does and what Miles did, but with transit 
primarily in the Philadelphia area. Outside of their blog, they're very interested in the Eliot Deviation Index.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJUXNkno_9J6_YSsy6Gbig">Selig's Trains and Travels</a> by Selig. Selig 
is a bit far behind when it comes to uploading his videos, but he puts out entertaining videos about his adventures on 
public transit, usually in the Bay Area of California. <!-- Shh, I have a crush on Selig. --> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIneKNAyQfzZrJEdXzzYn1Q">Stormy Kara</a> by ... Stormy. They live just outside Chicago (hey hey hey now, stay tuned) and go on various transit adventures around the region, in addition to creating the "Transit Talk" series ranting about a variety of transit topics.</p>
<p><a href="https://theprovidenceplanner.wordpress.com">Stroadsblog RI</a> by Cedric. Cedric was the one 
who collaborated with me on the <a href="/2021-08/ri-intrastate-rail.html">Rhode Island Instrastate Rail</a> post 
with me in August 2021. Cedric's blog has more in-depth content about RIPTA and Rhode Island and he put far more 
effort into his posts than I do. Unfortunately, The Providence Planner went defunct in January 2022, but returned that May as Stroadsblog RI (and has since shut down).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yimby.club">Trainably / YIMBY.club</a> by Eric (and some other guests). Eric doesn't really post that often on his blog, but 
whenever he does, it's a quality post. He often procrastinates with whatever project he is thinking of. Trainably merged into YIMBY.club in July 2022, a collaborative blog that I have a post on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.traipsingthrutransit.com">Traipsing Through Transit</a> by Jonah. They live in the New York City area and have some of the best transit proposals I've laid my eyes on, as well as some reviews similar to those of Cod's internet nook and Miles in Transit.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this blog!</p>
