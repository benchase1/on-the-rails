<h1>About the Editor</h1>

<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>My name is Ben, and I live in central Massachusetts and aspire to be a transportation planner 
    in the future. I enjoy riding transit when I can and starting this blog is an exciting new project!
</p>

<p>My only experience with anything related to this was when I wrote a guest post on the popular 
    blog "Miles in Transit", and <a href="http://milesintransit.com/2019/09/23/guest-post-grafton/">my guest post</a> was on the Grafton MBTA station, which I have also wrote about 
    <a href="2021-07/grafton-mbta.html">on this blog</a>. I'm also a photographer.
</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this blog!</p>
