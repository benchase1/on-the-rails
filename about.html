<h1>About the Editor</h1>

<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>My name is Ben, I live in central Massachusetts and aspire to be a transportation planner 
    in the future. I enjoy riding transit when I can and starting this blog is an exciting new project!
</p>

<p>I was born on October 17, 2003 (age 18) in Massachusetts and I've been a transit enhusiast since March 2009. 
    I'm also a filmmaker and photographer. I identify as bisexual and use he/him pronouns.
</p>

<p>My only experience with anything related to this was when I wrote a guest post on the popular 
    blog "Miles in Transit", and <a href="http://milesintransit.com/2019/09/23/guest-post-grafton/">my guest post</a> was on the Grafton MBTA station, which I have also wrote about 
    <a href="2021-07/grafton-mbta.html">on this blog</a>.
</p>

<h3>Why? Just why?</h3>

<p>(I may have a catchphrase here of "Why? Just why?")</p>

<p>Why do I write a transit blog? What made me write one?</p>

<p>The first question is an easy one for me to answer - I enjoy it. Even if I only put a few minutes 
    of effort into this each time, it's something for me to talk about with people like Cedric (the guy 
    behind The Providence Planner). I might even be able to use this to my advantage in the future, you never know.
</p>

<p>The second one, however, is slightly harder. There are a few others I know who also write similar blogs. 
    I always enjoy reading these other blogs, and I have a slight bit of experience, so I just went with it.
</p>

<p>Below is a list of blogs that I have read and fully recommend for any reader of On the Rails.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.milesintransit.com">Miles in Transit</a> by Miles. My guest post in September 2019 
was what inspired me to write about what I like here. Miles is a great person and puts great content on his blog 
and YouTube channel of the same name.</p>
<p><a href="https://theprovidenceplanner.wordpress.com">The Providence Planner</a> by Cedric. Cedric was the one 
who collaborated with me on the <a href="/2021-08/ri-intrastate-rail.html">Rhode Island Instrastate Rail</a> post 
with me in August 2021. Cedric's blog has more in-depth content about RIPTA and Rhode Island and he puts far more 
effort into his posts than I do.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trainably.xyz">Trainably</a> by Eric. Eric doesn't really post that often on his blog, but 
whenever he does, it's a quality post. He often procrastinates with whatever project he is thinking of.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this blog!</p>
