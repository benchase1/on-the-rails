<h1>About the Editor</h1>

<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>Hello there! My name is Ben, I was born and raised in the suburbs of 
    Worcester, Massachusetts, but now reside in Chicago, pursuing higher education. I currently aspire to be a transit planner in the future. I enjoy riding transit 
    when I get the opportunity to, but my main interest with transit is how routes and stops are planned out.
</p>

<p>I was born on October 17, 2003 (age 19) in Massachusetts and I've been a transit nerd since I was very young, falling 
    in love with both the MBTA in Boston and the MTA in New York City. I'm also a photographer. 
</p>

<p>This blog is where the <a href=https://edi.benchase.info>Eliot Deviation Index</a> was first <a href=2022-05/eliot-deviation-index.html>introduced</a>, and it grew to the point where I set up a whole new site just for it.</p>

<h3>Why? Just why?</h3>

<p>(I may have a catchphrase here of "Why? Just why?")</p>

<p>Why do I write a transit blog? What made me write one?</p>

<p>The first question is an easy one for me to answer - I enjoy it. Even if I only put a few minutes 
    of effort into this each time, it's something for me to talk about with people like Cedric (the guy 
    behind Stroadsblog RI). I might even be able to use this to my advantage in the future, you never know.
</p>

<p>The second one, however, is slightly harder. There are a few others I know who also write similar blogs. 
    I always enjoy reading these other blogs, and I have a slight bit of experience, so I just went with it.
</p>

<p>Below is a list of related blogs and YouTube channels from some friends of mine that I fully recommend for any 
    reader of Based on Transit.
</p>
<p><a href="http://codsnook.hopto.org/">Chelsea's Corner</a> by Chelsea. They're on a quest to review every bus route 
and train station in southern New England, showing their experiences on the journeys to ride these routes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ClassyWhale">Classy Whale</a> by Caleb. Caleb posts a great video every week, 
usually focusing on transit and the sights around it. Thinks Based on Transit is "a really cool blog, you should check it out."</p>
<p><a href="https://ranyasramblings.blogspot.com/">Ranya's Ramblings</a> by Ranya. They do what Cod does and what Miles did, but with transit 
primarily in the Philadelphia area. Outside of their blog, they're very interested in the Eliot Deviation Index.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJUXNkno_9J6_YSsy6Gbig">Selig's Trains and Travels</a> by Selig. Selig 
is a bit far behind when it comes to uploading his videos, but he puts out entertaining videos about his adventures on 
public transit, usually in the Bay Area of California. <!-- Shh, I have a crush on Selig. --> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIneKNAyQfzZrJEdXzzYn1Q">Stormy Kara</a> by ... Stormy. They live in Chicago (hey hey hey now, stay tuned) and go on various transit adventures around the region, in addition to creating the "Transit Talk" series ranting about a variety of transit topics.</p>
<p><a href="https://theprovidenceplanner.wordpress.com">Stroadsblog RI</a> by Cedric. Cedric was the one 
who collaborated with me on the <a href="/2021-08/ri-intrastate-rail.html">Rhode Island Instrastate Rail</a> post 
with me in August 2021. Cedric's blog has more in-depth content about RIPTA and Rhode Island and he put far more 
effort into his posts than I do. Unfortunately, The Providence Planner went defunct in January 2022, but returned that May as Stroadsblog RI (and has since shut down).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yimby.club">Trainably / YIMBY.club</a> by Eric (and some other guests). Eric doesn't really post that often on his blog, but 
whenever he does, it's a quality post. He often procrastinates with whatever project he is thinking of. Trainably merged into YIMBY.club in July 2022, a collaborative blog that I have a post on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.traipsingthrutransit.com">Traipsing Through Transit</a> and <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@honajtransit>Honaj Transit</a> by Jonah. He lives in New York City and has some of the best transit proposals I've laid my eyes on. Really likes boats.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.walkingtransfer.com/">Walking Transfer</a> by Brooke. As of Feburary 2023, she is just starting out their blog, but she is super knowledgable about the operations side of the MBTA, mainly specializing in the reliablity of the ever-aging old Orange Line fleet, and the issue-ridden new CRRC fleet.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this blog!</p>
