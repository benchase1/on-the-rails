<h3>August 8, 2021</h3> 
<p>I'm still alive everyone! I've just been away for away for a week and decided not to write any blog posts. I'm back and continuing where I left off in my RIPTA ranting. This time - the 3.</p>
<p>The 3 has a much less hectic schedule and route than the 1. The 3 runs between the Providence train station and Oakland Beach, a beach located southeast of TF Green Airport in Warwick. Looking at the map, it has a straight-forward route. That's nice.</p>
<p>On weekdays, it starts running at 5:03 am from Oakland Beach, and runs every 40-ish minutes until 6:19 pm, where it runs every 80 minutes until the last trip at 8:59 pm. It starts about an hour later in the opposite direction, and switches from 40 minutes to 80 minutes at 6:48 pm, until the last trip at 9:28 pm. It runs every 70 minutes from 6:28 am to 8:28 pm on Saturdays southbound, and 6:16 am to 7:06 pm northbound (still every 70). It gets worse on Sundays - every 100 minutes (1 hour 40) from 7:18 am to 6:58 pm going north, and 7:58 am to 7:38 pm southbound.</p>
<p>It takes about 35 minutes to travel between Oakland Beach and Providence. The route sees an average of 956 passengers on weekdays, and an estimated 516 on Saturdays and 258 on Sundays.</p>
