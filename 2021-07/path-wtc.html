<h1>World Trade Center (PATH)</h1> 
<h3>July 24, 2021</h3> 
<p>Before actually taking the train here, I've had two previous encounters with this station. This place is actually more than just a PATH station, as it has a shopping center here and a connection to the NYC subway.</p>
<p>I first saw this station in August 2009 when I was on vacation in NYC. The station was under construction at the time, and I didn't know what it would be. I also didn't know why it was being built. 5 year old Ben didn't know what 9/11 was. There was an old station destroyed in the attacks, and this place opened in 2016.</p>
<p>I was also here in the spring of 2017. Me and my family went to the top of the World Trade Center, and we made our way out of the building and into this place. I found it to be very nice inside.</p>
<p>Finally, our hectic trip back from New Jersey ended here, and we hopped on the subway to get back to our hotel.</p>

Exiting the paid area.</p>
<p>I found the station within the paid area to be very spacious. There was a lot of space when we came through at 5:00 on a Saturday. This might be busier during peak travel times.</p>

<p>After leaving the paid area of the PATH station, we walked across this shopping area. I found the shops to be more higher-end here. The area had this beautiful high ceiling inside as well.</p>

<p>The complex also has these balconies on the upper floors for people to look down. We didn't go up there at all.</p>
<p>After that, we safely returned to our hotel.</p>
