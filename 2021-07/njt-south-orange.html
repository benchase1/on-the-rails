<title>South Orange - On the Rails</title> 
<h1>South Orange</h1> 
<h3>July 19, 2021</h3> 
<p>I went to New York City over the weekend. I also went to New Jersey during the trip. We were going to see a few colleges, and Seton Hall was one on our list to visit.</p>
<p>To get there? We took the train to South Orange. I also took pictures.</p>
<p>South Orange has a really nice station in a really good location. All the other NJ Transit stations we passed along the way were near town centers. That's really good compared to the MBTA who built train stations a bit away from the town center, and more like a park-and-ride.</p>

The nicest of the station entrances I saw. There was a nice fountain in front of it.</p>

<p>Let's get into some stuff about the station itself.</p>
<p>The station (like most other NJT stations along the way out) had a mostly low-level platform, with a mini-high similar to MBTA stations.</p>
<p>However, the station had a nice station building accessible from the platforms via stairs. These were locked when we arrived.</p>
<p>Also, NJT put up schedules on both platforms for passengers to view (not like the MBTA who attached them to a larger station sign. These were in nice stands.)</p>

The outbound platform viewed from the inbound platform. The covering provided much appreciated help during this stormy day.</p>

The outbound platform has a sign for the nearby Seton Hall University.</p>

The tracks go directly straight from here.</p>
<p>Overall, South Orange is a really nice station. It's a shame the inside wasn't open (or we couldn't find the entrance).</p>
