<title>Welcome to On the Rails! - Based on Transit</title> 
<h1>Welcome to On the Rails!</h1> 
<h3>July 11, 2021</h3> 
<p>Hello!</p> 
<p>Welcome to On the Rails! This is a new transit blog covering transit around the United States (probably will be northeast stuff). This will be very similar to other blogs known to the Miles Discord gang / cult.</p> 
<p>It's 1:28 am as I write this. I'm tired.</p> 
<p>Also - this isn't really a great blog, but I'm too lazy to set up actual blog software for this.</p>
