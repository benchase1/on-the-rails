<h3>September 24, 2021</h3> 
<p>The WRTA has some really long route names. I had to remove the Stop and Shop it, sorry. I prefer the RIPTA ones better. Anyways, on to the actual route.</p>
<p>The B is another route that serves Northbridge and Grafton and was created at the same time as the A. This one however does not go all the way to Walmart and goes further into Grafton and all the way to the MBTA station.</p>
<p>Whoops it actually does go to Walmart they just didn't put Walmart in the route name like they do with the A, the 4, and the 30.</p>
<p>The B starts considerable earlier in the day, with the first trip leaving Walmart at 5:27 am and getting to the T station at 6:03 am. This is only one of four northbound trips serving the T station, the others arriving at 7:03 am, 6:00 pm, and 7:00 pm. All the other hourly trips terminate at the Grafton Stop and Shop.</p>
<p>There are also four southbound trips from the T station about 10 - 15 minutes after the northbound trips arrive. These are very well timed with the train going to and from Boston, ideal for a 9 to 5 commuter.</p>
<p>What bothers me with this route is that all the southbound trips and one northbound trip to the T station are closed-door express to / from the New Village. WHY? Who from the New Village is travelling to the Grafton T station? Why can't it just stop everywhere else? Who benefits here? It just doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>That being said, the B is a really good route. It provides hourly bus service between Northbridge and Grafton and places people would want to go to on a regular basis. I do wish it ran later at night to about 8 or 9 pm, especially since it starts running at 5 am. It doesn't serve as many pizza places as the A though.</p>
