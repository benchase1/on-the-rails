<h3>May 24, 2022</h3> 
<p>On today's episode of "what the fuck"... wait... wait again... <a href=../2022-04/wrta-19.html>I've used that intro before, you might have recongized it</a>. You know the drill, here's something that's good for the WRTA.</p>
<p>The 7 is a mostly residential-focused route running between Union Station and the Washington Heights Apartments near Webster Square in the southwest of Worcester. The routing focuses on running down residential streets for the majority for the majority of the route. The route goes down Chandler Street, past the Chandler Street Elementary School. (Fun fact - the school's principal offered to write my college letter of recommendation last August after meeting me a few hours prior. I already had two teachers of mine agree to write letters for me, and I unfortunately had to decline.) The route travels down Park Ave, with most trips deviating to the intersection of Maywood St and Lovell St, in the middle of a residential neighborhood. Only four trips in each direction on weekdays do not make this deviation. The route travels down Mill St to the final destination at the Washington Heights Apartments. Some trips deviate to the Coes Pond Village Apartments on request outbound, with limited scheduled service inbound.</p>
<p>What I really like about this route is scheduling. While it's not as good as some other routes, it works well for a residential route like the 7. The route runs with 30 to 40 minute headways between 5 am and 8 pm on weekdays. On Saturdays, the route runs roughly the same hours, 6 am to 9 pm, but trips are every 45 to 50 minutes. Sunday service exists as well, with trips every 55 minutes between 11 am and 5 pm. There are two extra outbound trips, one at 9:35 am and one at 5:50 pm, 2 hours before and after the other trips. Trips take about 25 minutes to complete from end to end.</p>
<p>Coes Pond Village sees inbound service scheduled every 90 minutes to 2 hours on weekdays, every 2 to 3 hours on Saturdays, and only 3 trips (at 9:39 am, 1:19 pm, and 3:09 pm) on Sundays.</p>
<p>The 7 also interlines on weekends! On Saturdays, inbound 7 trips interline with the 23 and on Sundays, inbound 7 trips interline with the 24, both providing one-seat rides to the eastern side of Worcester.</p>
