<h3>November 19, 2021</h3> 
<p>It’s been a really long time since I’ve written about a train station here. Fortunately, I’ve been to New Haven’s main train station, Union Station, a few times in my life. </p>
<p>New Haven actually has two train stations, Union Station, as well as a smaller station, State Street, which I have never visited.</p>
<p>Union Station is a big station. It’s got 8 tracks for trains to stop on, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 14. All the tracks are at least partially covered with a canopy and connected to the other tracks and the main station building through an underground corridor. All of the platforms are island platforms and are fully-high level.</p>
<p>The station building is really nice, and has a banner commemorating the station’s 100th anniversary. The building has plenty of ticket windows for Amtrak, Shore Line East, Hartford Line, and Metro-North, as well as ticket machines for all operators. A very large display is at one end displaying all the upcoming train departures and track assignments. Smaller displays are located around the station with the same information. There are also small stores inside, including a Dunkin’ Donuts.</p>
<p>The train serves as the terminus for Metro-North New Haven Line trains to New York, Hartford Line trains to Springfield, and Shore Line East trains to New London.</p>

<p>There is also a large parking garage located adjacent to the station. You can see the platforms of the station from the garage.</p>
